# SMS_Spam_Detection
Text spam, or unsolicited messages, presents a persistent challenge in communication platforms, ranging from emails to SMS. This project aims to provide a robust solution for identifying and filtering out such spam messages.
Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathering a dataset containing both spam and non-spam messages.
Cleaning and preprocessing the data, which may involve removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and converting text into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).

Feature Engineering:
Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as word frequency, n-grams, presence of specific keywords, or patterns indicative of spam.

Algorithm Selection:
Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or more advanced techniques like deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or CNN).

Model Training:
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the chosen machine learning model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluating the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Utilizing techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness of the model.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tuning the model parameters and hyperparameters to improve performance.

Deployment:
Integrating the trained model into a user-friendly interface or application.
Providing real-time or batch spam detection functionalities.

Feedback Loop and Updating:
Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the model's performance.
Periodically updating the model with new data to adapt to evolving spamming techniques.

Performance Monitoring:
Monitoring the spam detector's performance over time to ensure it maintains its effectiveness.
Implementing mechanisms to detect and handle concept drift, where the characteristics of spam messages change over time.

Scalability:
Designing the system to handle large volumes of incoming messages efficiently.
Ensuring scalability of the solution as the volume of data and user base grows.

Interpretability:
Providing insights into why certain messages are classified as spam or non-spam, which can help build trust in the model's decisions.

The dataset was taken was Kaggle.
Made as project for Bharat Intern.
